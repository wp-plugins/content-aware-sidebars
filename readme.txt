== Description ==

Manage an infinite number of sidebars. Make your WordPress site even more dynamic and boost SEO by controlling what content the sidebars should be displayed with.

No extra database tables or table columns will be added.

	* Specific (custom) post types
	* Specific page templates
	* Singulars containing specific taxonomies or taxonomy terms
	* Singulars made by specific authors
	* Specific post type archives, author archives, taxonomy archives or taxonomy term archives
	* Search results, 404 page and front page
	* Any combination of the above
* Merge new sidebars with others, replace them or simply add them to your theme manually with a template tag
* Create complex content with nested sidebars
* Private sidebars only for members
* Schedule sidebars for later publishing

= How do I use display_ca_sidebar()? =

This function is optional and handles all sidebars that are set to be handled manually. It can be inserted anywhere on your site in any quantity, either as it is, or with the following parameters:

`$args = array(
'include' => '',
'before' => '<div id="sidebar" class="widget-area"><ul class="xoxo">',
'after' => '</ul></div>'
);`


If ID's of specific sidebars are passed to `include`, the function will only handle these. The visuals of the content aware sidebars can be modified by passing `before` and `after`.
The function accepts URL-style strings as parameters too, like the standard WordPress Template Tags.

== Screenshots ==

2. Simple overview of all created Content Aware Sidebars
3. Add widgets to the newly added sidebar
4. Viewing front page of site. `Main Sidebar` is displayed
5. Viewing Another Page. The Content Aware Sidebar has replaced `Main Sidebar`
